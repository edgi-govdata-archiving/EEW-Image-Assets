# EEW Image Assets
This repo exists to create public links for images, especially those that need to be referenced in Notebook markdown.

## How to contribute to this repo
* Make or look for a folder for the image assets based on use
* Add a note to the `Organization of this repo` section below to explain the new folder

## Organization of this repo
* Jupyter instructions: contains image assets for explanations of how Jupyter works, at the top of each Notebook
* Organizational flowcharts: has images for how the event breakout rooms are organized

# Default branch - 'main'
The 'master' branch is no longer the repo's primary branch in line with EDGI's policy decided here: https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/overview/issues/241

> If someone has a local clone, they can update their locals like this:
```
$ git checkout master
$ git branch -m master main
$ git fetch
$ git branch --unset-upstream
$ git branch -u origin/main
$ git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD refs/remotes/origin/main
```
> The above steps accomplish:
> - Go to the master branch
> - Rename master to main locally
> - Get the latest commits from the server
> - Remove the link to origin/master
> - Add a link to origin/main
> - Update the default branch to be origin/main
